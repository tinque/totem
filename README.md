# Totem

## Project Description

Totem is a Go tool to extract, merge, and deduplicate contacts from SGDF (Scouts et Guides de France) intranet export files and Gmail contacts. It generates a Gmail-compatible CSV file, making it easy to manage and synchronize scout contacts.

**SGDF** stands for "Scouts et Guides de France", a major French scouting organization. The tool is designed to process their intranet export files.


## How to Build

Requirements: Go â‰¥ 1.25.

### Build for your platform (manual)
Clone the repository and build with:
```sh
go build -o totem main.go
```

### Build for all platforms (recommended)
To build binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows (both amd64 and arm64), use the provided script:

```sh
bash build_all.sh
```

This will create binaries in the `build/` directory, named like:
```
build/totem-v1.0-darwin-amd64
build/totem-v1.0-linux-amd64
build/totem-v1.0-windows-amd64.exe
...etc
```
The version is automatically detected from the latest git tag (e.g., `v1.0`). If no tag is present, the version will be `dev`.

The `build/` directory is ignored by git and safe for binary outputs.

## How to Use

Example usage:

```sh
./totem -intranet "20250916 - exportIndividus.xls" -gmail "contacts.csv" -out "output.csv"
```

- `-intranet`: path to the SGDF intranet export file (required)
- `-gmail`: path to the Gmail contacts CSV file (optional)
- `-out`: path to the output CSV file (optional, default: output.csv)


## Download & Use Pre-built Binaries

You can download ready-to-use binaries from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/tinque/totem/releases).

1. Go to the release page and download the binary matching your platform:
	- macOS (Intel): `totem-v1.0-darwin-amd64`
	- macOS (Apple Silicon): `totem-v1.0-darwin-arm64`
	- Linux (Intel): `totem-v1.0-linux-amd64`
	- Linux (ARM): `totem-v1.0-linux-arm64`
	- Windows: `totem-v1.0-windows-amd64.exe` or `totem-v1.0-windows-arm64.exe`
2. Place the binary in your desired folder and make it executable (if needed):
	- On macOS/Linux: `chmod +x totem-v1.0-*`
3. Run the binary as shown below:
	```sh
	./totem-v1.0-darwin-amd64 -intranet "20250916 - exportIndividus.xls" -gmail "contacts.csv" -out "output.csv"
	```

The generated file is compatible with Gmail import.
