## Project Description

Totem is a Go tool to extract, merge, and deduplicate contacts from SGDF (Scouts et Guides de France) intranet export files and Gmail contacts. It generates a Gmail-compatible CSV file, making it easy to manage and synchronize scout contacts.

**SGDF** stands for "Scouts et Guides de France", a major French scouting organization. The tool is designed to process their intranet export files.
